  C version
  An interactive demonstration of the speed of matrix multiplication.
Version 1.0c, last compiled on 25-MAR-92.  This version is for a Apple Macintosh

If you've never used this program before, type EXPLAIN.

Command?  (Type H for help):The algorithm chosen is IJK
The leading dimension of arrays, LDA, is 128
The maximum legal choice for LDA is 128
The actual size of the arrays, N, is 16
A total of 0 cases have been run.
Valid choices for the order are:
  ALL R8_IJK IIJK IUJK UIJK IJUK
  IJK IKJ JIK JKI KIJ KJI PIJKA PIJKP TAXPYC TAXPYR TDOT
Command?  (Type H for help):The value of N that you chose is not acceptable!
N must be no greater than 128
Command?  (Type H for help):This is the list of legal commands.
H           Help. List the legal commands.
LDA=value   Assigns the leading dimension of arrays.
M           Multiply two matrices.
N=value     Assigns the size of the arrays.
ORDER=name  Chooses the algorithm for multiplication.
P           Prints out current values and results.
Q           Quit.
NOSHOW=name Value of NAME should not be included in output.
            NAME=ORDER, LDA, N, TIME, OPS or MFLOPS
SHOW=name   Value of NAME should be included in output.
            NAME=ORDER, LDA, N, TIME, OPS or MFLOPS

Command?  (Type H for help):ORDER has been set to R8_IJK

Command?  (Type H for help):Please type "Y" to confirm that you want to quit.
Command?  (Type H for help):A copy of your input is in the file matmul.inp
A copy of your results is in the file matmul.dat
A copy of the entire session is in the file matmul.out
