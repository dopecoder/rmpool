Command?  (Type H for help):P
The algorithm chosen is IJK
The leading dimension of arrays, LDA, is 128
The maximum legal choice for LDA is 128
The actual size of the arrays, N, is 16
A total of 0 cases have been run.
Command?  (Type H for help):N=100000
The value of N that you chose is not acceptable!
N must be no greater than 128
Command?  (Type H for help):H
This is the list of legal commands.
H           Help. List the legal commands.
LDA=value   Assigns the leading dimension of arrays.
M           Multiply two matrices.
N=value     Assigns the size of the arrays.
ORDER=name  Chooses the algorithm for multiplication.
P           Prints out current values and results.
Q           Quit.
NOSHOW=name Value of NAME should not be included in output.
            NAME=ORDER, LDA, N, TIME, OPS or MFLOPS
SHOW=name   Value of NAME should be included in output.
            NAME=ORDER, LDA, N, TIME, OPS or MFLOPS

Command?  (Type H for help):ORDER=R8_IJK
